Database stores black and white cards
[ability to select different decks]


Randomise and deal 1 shared black card – to card tzar to judge, card tzar changes each round
[other game mode all voting, rather than card tzar]

Randomise and deal to each player several (10) white cards
[discard full hand and redraw]
[Rando Cardrissian – just plays 2 cards]
Note some black cards require multiple response cards

Person deemed to have funniest answer wins the round and gains point
cards used go to bottom of deck and new cards given to each player back up to hand limit

Game ends when a player reaches score limit
[variable score limit]
[make a haiku ending]
